## ScrabbleGame

Hello everyone ✋!<br>
This is our project in Advanced software development course in College Of Management Academic Studies.<br>
We built the game - <b>Srabble game:</b>
Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.
