## ScrabbleGame

Hello everyone ✋!<br>
This is our project in Advanced software development course in College Of Management Academic Studies.
We built the game - Srabble game.

<h5>Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.</h5>
## Scrabble Game Rules
<p>
  1. You are to make a word using your tiles. The longer the word, the
better—try to make words longer than three letters unless you can get
lots (10 or more) of points for a short word.
2. You must use tiles already on the board as part of the word you spell
(you can’t just start a new word anywhere you want).
3. Words may only go from top-to-bottom or from left-to-right.
4. Any tile touching another tile must spell a real word (except tiles that
only touch corner tips—they don’t count).
5. You may only spell English words.
6. You may not use abbreviations, acronyms, proper nouns or
inappropriate words.
7. If you have all consonants or all vowels, you may trade your tiles
from the bag and then take your turn.
8. If you think you can’t make a word, trade however many tiles you
want with the bag, then skip your turn (try not to trade your tiles).
9. You may not trade tiles with other players.
10. You may not show other players your tiles, or ask them for help.
11. Count the points on the tiles of the word(s) you spell (*doubling or
tripling letters or words as needed). This is your score.
12. After you announce your score, as long as no one challenges, take
enough tiles from the bag so you have seven tiles on your rack.
* You only get to count the double/triple letter/word scores if you put the tile over
that space—if someone else placed the tile there, and you use that tile as part
of your word, you do not get to double or triple anything/
